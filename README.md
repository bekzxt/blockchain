**SMART CONTRACT**
The main idea of this project is to create and deploy a smart contract that can:
- Receive Ether tokens.
- Allow the contract owner to withdraw all Ether from the smart contract's balance.
- Provide a function to check the smart contract's balance.

1. **Main Page**  
   - Contains primary information about the project and its objectives.

2. **Contract Deployment Page**  
   - Instructions on deploying the smart contract to Ganache or a public testnet.

3. **Interaction Page**  
   - Demonstrates how to interact with the smart contract using web3.js and Metamask.

4. **Examples**  
   - Practical examples of function calls (e.g., checking balance, sending Ether).

5. **Screenshots & Logs**  
   - Visual and textual logs for easier understanding of the workflow.
